							<h3>Everything Looks like a Nail</h3>
							<p>The claw hammer has a "claw" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America. Other types of hammer vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers.</p>

							<h3>How to Choose a Drill Bit</h3>
							<p>Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers. Although most hammers are hand tools, powered hammers, such as steam hammers and trip hammers, are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm. There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses.</p>

							<h3>Pressure’s On: How to Clean Your Driveway Well</h3>
							<p>In ancient China, the trip hammer evolved out of the use of the mortar and pestle, which in turn gave rise to the treadle-operated tilt-hammer (Chinese: 碓 Pinyin: dui; Wade-Giles: tui). The latter was a simple device employing a lever and fulcrum (operated by pressure applied by the weight of one's foot to one end), which featured a series of catches or lugs on the main revolving shaft as well.</p>

							<h3>Introducing: Ask An Expert</h3>
							<p>The latter book states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar (which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel and trip-hammer were in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China (for water-powered Chinese metallurgy, see Du Shi).</p>

							<h3>Spring’s Here: What to Plant Based on your Region and Tastes</h3>
							<p>In his Rou Xing Lun, the government official Kong Rong (153–208 AD) remarked that the invention of the trip hammer was an excellent example of a product created by intelligent men during his own age (comparing the relative achievements of the sages of old). During the 3rd century AD, the high government official and engineer Du Yu established the use of combined trip hammer batteries (lian zhi dui), which employed several shafts that were arranged to work off one large waterwheel.</p>

							<h3>Caring for Batteries</h3>
							<p>n Chinese texts of the 4th century, there are written accounts of men possessing and operating hundreds of trip hammer machines, such as the venerable mathematician Wang Rong (died 306 AD), Deng Yu (died 326 AD), and Shi Chong (died 300 AD), responsible for the operation of hundreds of trip hammers in over thirty governmental districts throughout China. There are numerous references to trip hammers during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD) and Song Dynasty (960–1279), and there are Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) references that report the use of trip hammers in papermills of Fujian Province.</p>

							<h3>New Dremel Bits</h3>
							<p>An obscure and perhaps corrupt passage in the Natural History of the Roman scholar Pliny (NH 18.23) was taken by some historians to indicate that water-driven pestles had become widespread in Italy by the 1st century AD. Although the majority of Roman water-powered sites that have been identified were for grain milling, there is a possibility that water power was used to drive an ore-crushing hammer at the Roman gold mine at Dolaucothi by the end of the first century AD.</p>

							<p>Here, the regularity and spacing of large indentations on the Pumsaint stone indicate the use of a water-powered trip hammer. Such abraded stones have been found at the Iberian peninsula in Spain and Portugal, where the datable examples are from the 1st and 2nd century AD.</p>

							<h3>Installing Floating Shelves</h3>
							<p>Water-powered and mechanised trip hammers reappeared in medieval Europe by the 12th century. Their use was described in medieval written sources of Styria (in modern-day Austria), written in 1135 and another in 1175 AD.</p>

							<h3>How to Work with a Paint Sprayer</h3>
							<p>Medieval French sources of the years 1116 and 1249 both record the use of mechanised trip hammers used in the forging of wrought iron. Medieval European trip hammers by the 15th century were most often in the shape of the vertical pestle stamp-mill, although they employed more frequent use of the vertical waterwheel than earlier Chinese versions (which often used the horizontal waterwheel).</p>

							<h3>What to Look for in a General Contractor</h3>
							<p>The well-known Renaissance artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci often sketched trip hammers for use in forges and even file-cutting machinery, those of the vertical pestle stamp-mill type. The oldest depicted European illustration of a martinet forge-hammer is perhaps the Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus of Olaus Magnus, dated to 1565 AD.</p>
